<h1 class="text-2xl md:mx-30 text-center px-4 mx-4"><b>Palestine in Northfield</b> (PIN) grew out of an identified need and desire to <b>do</b> unemcumbered actions, <b>share</b> what's happening anywhere in Northfield and nearby areas, <b>support</b> each other's efforts, and <b>amplify</b> the work of each individual group (PIN, NJP/I, and Students for Justice in Palestine at St. Olaf College/Carleton College).</h1>
<h1 class="text-2xl md:mx-30 text-center mt-8 px-4 mx-4">Through our emails, the Instagram page, and this website, we seek to connect the Northfield Palestinian activist community and reduce isolated silos of initiatives. PIN is loosely, flexibly, and gently organized, spontaneous and nimble; PIN shares the work of other groups and also works independently. We invite you to come to our Sunday night zoom meetings. Please email us or use the contact form for more information.</h1>
